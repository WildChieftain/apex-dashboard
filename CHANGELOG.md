# Changelog

## 1.1.1 (2025-05-29)

### Fixed
- Library section config (filters, view mode, sort, page size) lost after restart — replaced custom YAML parser with `yaml` package to correctly handle nested objects in frontmatter
- Card grid position (gcol/grow) never serialized to file — empty `lines.push()` calls replaced with proper key-value output
- Write race condition — `lastWrittenHash` now set after file write completes instead of before, preventing stale data overwrite during rapid updates

## 1.0.9 (2025-05-26)

### Improved
- Pomodoro ring stroke width increased from 3px to 6px for better visibility
- Pomodoro dots moved inside the ring, positioned below the time display
- Stats hint (today count) moved to the top-left corner of the pomodoro widget, on the same line as the title
- Reduced pomodoro widget gap from 6px to 4px for a more compact layout
- All slider settings now show current value in the title (recent edits count, pomodoro work/break/interval)
- Weather API now has fallback: primary `api.open-meteo.com` with backup `archive-api.open-meteo.com`

### Fixed
- Stats hint now always visible (shows "Today 0" even when no sessions completed)
- Stats hint no longer displays total count, only today count
- Title "Pomodoro" stays centered with stats hint on the left
